        <h2 class="text-center"> K </h2>
          <li> K is a proportion of [products] over [reactants] at equilibrium. </li>
        <h2 class="text-center"> Q </h2>
           <li> Q is a proportion of [products] over [reactants] initially. </li>
        <h2 class="text-center">K Vs Q</h2>
           <li> If Q is bigger than K, the reverse direction needs to be taken to reach equilibrium </li>
           <li>If Q is less than K, the forward direction needs to be taken to reach equilibrium </li>
           <li>If Q is equal to K, equilibrium has already been reached </li>
        <h2 class="text-center">Equilibrium shifts and Le Chatelier</h5>
          <li> Adding a reactant would make the equilibrium shift to the left. </li>
          <li> Adding a product would make the reaction shift to the right. </li>
          <li> Adding pressure would shift the equilibrium to the side with more moles of gas. </li>

        <h2 class="text-center"> Buffers </h2>
          <li> Buffers are solutions that maintain a constant pH. It has to have a weak acid with its conjugate base or a weak base with its conjugate acid. </li>
          <li> The equivalence point is when the moles of the titrant is equal to the moles of the titrate. It is when titration is complete. </li>

        <img id="img" src="img/bi6-images/Titration.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
          <li> A titration of a strong acid with a strong base would have an equivalence point at a pH of 7. </li>
          <li> A titration of a strong acid with a weak base would have an equivalence point at a pH less than 7. </li>
          <li> A titration of a weak acid with a strong base would have an equivalence point at a pH higher than 7. </li>
          <li>A titration of a weak acid with a weak base would have an equivalence point at a pH slightly lower than 7. </li>
          <li> Any titration of a weak acid, a buffer is formed before the equivalence point is reached. </li>

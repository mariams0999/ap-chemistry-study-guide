        <li> Net ionic equations should have only the ions that precipitate or react during a reaction. There should be no spectator ions, an ion that exists in the same form on both sides of the equation, in a net ionic equation.</li>

        <li> Group 1 ions, ammonium, and nitrate are always soluble.</li>
        <h2 class="text-center">Percent Yeild</h2>
        <img src="img/bi3-images/percent.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="float: right;">
        <li> It is a yield of products which tends to be less than a hundred percent. This shows that the reactants arenâ€™t pure.</li>
        <h2 class=" text-center;"> Redox Reactions</h2>
        <img src="img/bi3-images/LEO-GER.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
        <li> Redox Reactions are reactions that contain oxidation and reduction half-reactions in them.</li>
        <li> Oxidation half-reactions are written with the electrons placed at the product side.</li>
        <li> Reduction half-reactions are written with the electrons placed at the reactant side.</li>
        <li> Species that appear at the top of the series in your Electrode Potential table gain electrons most readily and therefore have the most positive E values. They are easily reduced and are the best oxidizing agent.</li>
        <li> Species that appear at the bottom of the series in your Electrode Potential table lose electrons most readily and therefore have the most negative E values. They are easily oxidized and are the best reducing agent.</li>
        <h2 class="text-center">Electrochemical Cells</h2>
        <li> Voltaic cells are spontaneous which means that the voltage of the cells must be negative.
            <img src="img/bi3-images/Voltaic-cells.jpg" class="img-thumnail">
            <li> Electrolysis are nonspontaneous and require a battery to work as a form of energy to force a reaction to happen.
                <img id="Electrolysis" src="img/bi3-images/Electrolysis.jpg" class="img-thumnail">
                <li> All electrochemical cells need a salt bridge to maintain neutrality.</li>
                <li> Anode is where the oxidation half-reaction takes place.
                    <li>
                        <li> Cathode is where the reduction half-reaction takes place.</li>
